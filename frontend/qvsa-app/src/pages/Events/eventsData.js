        description: `Tết, or Vietnamese Lunar New Year, is a vibrant and joyous celebration that 
                      marks the arrival of spring and new beginnings. Families come together to 
                      clean their homes and prepare special dishes, such as bánh chưng 
                      (sticky rice cake) and bánh dày (round rice cake), to offer to 
                      their ancestors. The streets are filled with colorful flowers, 
                      especially peach blossoms and kumquat trees, symbolizing prosperity and 
                      good fortune. People exchange gifts, visit friends and relatives, and 
                      enjoy traditional performances like lion dances and firecrackers.`,
